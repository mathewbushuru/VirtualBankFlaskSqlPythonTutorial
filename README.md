This repository is a tutorial for a python course that I teach at Funtrench limited. The tutorial specifically covers the Flask microframework. We do the setup and workflow of Flask. We then get a basic banking app running to show how to use templates and static content in Flask. We then show how to set up and use a database(Sqlite for simplicity). We then cover how to deploy the app to heroku
